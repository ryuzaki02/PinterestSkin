How to use if downloaded from .zip:
1. Go to Project Navigator in Xcode
2. Remove "DataCaching.xcodeproj"
3. Go to Project -> General -> Embedded Binaries -> Tap on "Add Other..." -> Select "DataCaching.xcodeproj" from folders -> Add
4. Again repeat step 3, only difference is now "DataCaching.xcodeproj" is already present on the list of frameworks just select it and Run.
